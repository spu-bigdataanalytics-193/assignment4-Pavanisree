In this assignment we used Spark to do map reduce algorithm as we did in our previous assignment in Jupyter notebook.
For doing this I used a Big data environment Google Colab and imported spark using the commands given in instructions. 
Once we are done with our installations I have imported my data in my google drive and called the data from Google drive 
to google colab. After getting the data I used a map reduce alogrithm and ran the program. It generally took less time than the earlier assignment as I used Spark which is the use case of Spark
